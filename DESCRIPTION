Title: Massive Graph Analysis
Author: See AUTHORS file.
Maintainer: Da Zheng <dzheng5@jhu.edu>
Description: FlashR extends the R programming framework. It executes R code
	in parallel automatically and stores and accesses arrays in the R code on
	disks automatically to scale R to large datasets that can't fit in memory.
	The core of FlashR is a small set of generalized operators to express data
	mining and machine learning algorithms in an array-oriented fashion.
	In addition to the generalized operators, FlashR reimplements many commonly
	used R functions to provide users a familiar R programming environment to
	reduce the learning curve. Furthermore, FlashR provides many R wrapper
	functions for graph algorithms implemented in FlashGraph.
