FlashR is an R package that extends the existing R matrix operations to process
datasets at a scale of terabytes in parallel and out of core automatically.
FlashR overrides many R matrix functions in the R "base" package so that users
can execute many existing R code in FlashR with no or little modification.
FlashR stores matrices on solid-state drives (SSDs) to scale to large datasets.
It executes many matrix operations together to achieve performance comparable
to optimized C implementations.
